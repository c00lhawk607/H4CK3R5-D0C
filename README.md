## What is it?
A doc that even lints the file you are working on! This uses the vim command already on Linux. H4CK3R5 D0C also encodes your file after you finish with base64 and pickle.
## How's it work?
It uses the command vim to view and edit a file that exists or does not.

## Currently supported os?
MacOS and Linux. Sorry windows.

## Help! I can't exit a file!!!
calm down. Press esc if you are in insert mode, then press :wq and hit enter. This will save your file and exit. press :q and hit enter if you do not want to save the file.
